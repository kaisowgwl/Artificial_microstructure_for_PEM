## Requirements
- MATLAB R2021a or later
- Image Processing Toolbox
- 3D Viewer Toolbox (for `viewer3d` and `volshow` functions)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Ensure the necessary toolboxes are installed in your MATLAB environment.

## Usage
1. Set the file paths and parameters at the beginning of the script.
2. Run the script to process the particle distribution, generate the microstructure with additives, and visualize the final structure.
3. The final structure is saved as an 8-bit TIFF file in the specified save folder.

## File Descriptions
- `main_script.m`: Main script to run the simulation and visualization.
- `process_particle_distribution.m`: Function to process the particle distribution.
- `generate_additive.m`: Function to generate the additive phase in the microstructure.
- `join_phases.m`: Function to join different phases in the microstructure.
- `final_structure.tif`: Output file containing the final microstructure saved as an 8-bit TIFF.

## Functions

### process_particle_distribution
```matlab
[inputs, microstructure3D] = process_particle_distribution(csv_filepath, inputs_filepath, voxel_size, savefolder, save_progression, save_verification, maxtime, refresheachs, domain_size, volumefraction_along_3rd_axis, run_number);
